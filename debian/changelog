  * Adapt to new xmlrpcpp header location (#164 <https://github.com/ros/geometry/issues/164>)
  * Maintain & expose tf2 Buffer in shared_ptr for tf (#163 <https://github.com/ros/geometry/issues/163>)
    - Adds a tf2_ros::Buffer via a public accessor
    method to expose to customers of Transformer
    - Maintains the tf2_ros::Buffer in a shared_ptr
    to safely share access to the Buffer object
    - As this is targeting Melodic, adds c++11 compile
    flags to grant access to std::shared_ptr's
    - Reorders the include_directories in the CMakeLists
    to ensure the headers exposed in this package are
    read *before* the system installed catkin_INCLUDE_DIRS
    (otherwise changes to tf source headers are never detected
    during a catkin_make on a system with ros-*-geometry
    installed)

    The empty yaml was coming through as a list not a dict so was breaking the expectations.

    axis).

    for certain corner case inputs.  This test demonstrates that bug.
  * Fix const correctness of tf::Vector3 rotate() method
    The method does not modify the class thus should be const.
    This has already been fixed in Bullet itself.

    a callback queue run by a different thread.  Specifically,
    maxRateTimerCallback() may be called after messages_mutex_ has been
    destroyed, causing a unrecoverable error.
