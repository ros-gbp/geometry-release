  * Install static lib and remove test for Android
  * Larger default queue size in broadcaster
    With queue_size=1 when two transforms are sent in quick succession,
    the second is often lost. The C++ code uses a default queue_size of

    a queue_size constructor argument is provided.

ros-kinetic-tf (1.10.7-0xenial) xenial; urgency=high

  * fix bug in tf::Matrix3x3::getEulerYPR()
    Fixes a bug in tf::Matrix3x3::getEulerYPR() implementation's handling
    of gimbal lock cases (when the new x axis aligns with the old +/-z
    axis).
  * add test that demonstrated bug in tf::Matrix3x3
    tf::Matrix3x3::getEulerYPR() has a bug which returns an incorrect rpy
    for certain corner case inputs.  This test demonstrates that bug.
  * Fix const correctness of tf::Vector3 rotate() method
    The method does not modify the class thus should be const.
    This has already been fixed in Bullet itself.
  * add automatic tf buffer cleaning on bag loop for python
    This logic was already implemented for c++
    but not for the python module.

  * Update listener.py
    Fix the tf listener service exception in rospy. See:
    http://answers.ros.org/question/10777/service-exception-using-tf-listener-in-rospy/
  * Fix MessageFilter race condition
    If MessageFilter does not explicitly stop its callback timer when it's
    being destroyed, there is a race condition when that timer is processed in
    a callback queue run by a different thread.  Specifically,
    maxRateTimerCallback() may be called after messages_mutex_ has been
    destroyed, causing a unrecoverable error.
